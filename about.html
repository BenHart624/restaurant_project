        <h2>OUR STORY BEGINS...</h2>
<p> Juan was a man of perfection and cared much for the culinary art form. Raising his family and first restaurant in 1970 at the capital of Costa Rica, San José, was ideal for Juan in his profession. For him it was about being were the chaos was as he fueled his passions with his experiences in the city. Using only the local markets as his source for ingredients. He set out to capture the most authentic flavor of Costa Rica with in his dishes.</p>
<p>    José, named after the city he was raised in, took over his father’s passions after spending his life learning and growing in the culinary world. His father’s expectation was high in the kitchen, which correlated to the man that José become today. Taking over his father’s restaurant in the heart of the capital in 1996. José has been able to not only maintain the authentic flavor, but also has raised the bar amongst his culinary peers.<p>
<p>  Juan’s Rice & Chicken is the same restaurant that opened up over 45 years ago with the understanding that food quality is to come first. Juan always said to those that asked, “when you have good food, good people will come.” Come to experience only the best that Costa Rica has to offer, as local fresh ingredients are the only things to go into the dishes. You will leave knowing you have tasted a piece of Costa Rica.</p>
